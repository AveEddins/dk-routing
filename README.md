# Container-based Action Routing Tool (CART)

A tool that enables the planning of container pickup and dropoff at many locations with customizables vehicles (speed, allowed roadways, capacity, etc.)

User instructions are at https://github.com/datakind/dk-routing/blob/main/dkroutingtool/README.md

Configuration manual is at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iOlXQk6_ElM_LdawJPREHNjVkv_2Qajam3is2hm5zyM

Developed by volunteers and DataKind, formerly known as DataKind Routing Tool

# Why would it be useful for me?

* There are hundreds or thousands of locations to visit
* Specific time windows are important constraints
* There needs to be multiple different vehicles with different speeds, allowable roads and capacities
* Visualizing detailed maps of the routes is necessary
* You'd like to edit the routes via spreadsheets
* Turn-by-turn navigation tools (e.g. OSM Automated Navigation Directions at https://osmand.net/) can be part of the toolset 

# Why does it look like?
